# Introduction to front-end testing

This chapter contains a detailed breakdown of techniques for creating UI tests and their effective coverage of the code base.

## What to test and why
Lets test UI components behavior with integration tests by using storybook & jest.
Lets test UI layout with [jest snapshots automated by storybook storyshots addon.](./snapshots.md)

Read a good article about what & why to test on UI [K.Odds "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)

## This is how we test
- [Create storybook for testable component](./storybook.md) 
- [Mock api, state, router, components](./mocks.md) 
- [Write stories](./stories.md) 
- [Test layout with snapshots](./snapshots.md)
- [Test stories with Jest](./writing-tests.md)
- [Measure tests coverage](./coverage.md)
- [Implement testing best practices](./best-practices.md)
